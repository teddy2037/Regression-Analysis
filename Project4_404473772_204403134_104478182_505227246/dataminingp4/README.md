# Project 4: Regression Analysis
## How to run our code:
The code should be run with Python 2. Please first download the datasets into the folder. 


Each file is labelled Dataset*\_Q#, where * is the dataset number (1,2, or 3), and Q# is the 
question number from the spec that the code corresponds to.

Several of the files are jupyter notebooks which should be opened and run with Jupyter.

The remaining files are python files that can be run with a command like

```python Dataset1_2a.py ```
